        <h2>Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14</h2>

        <p>Is a nicely built, fast performing, well-equipped laptop for way under $1,000 too much to ask for? The Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 firmly answers, offering that and more for around just $520. For that low price, it delivers snappy speeds, USB-C ports, a comfortable keyboard, and even a fingerprint scanner, all in a compact body with good battery life. There are some compromises—chiefly a lackluster display and speakers—but it’s still a tremendous value overall.</p>
    
        <p>If your needs are relatively simple and your targeted spend is much closer to $500 than $1,000, you can’t beat what this laptop has to offer. True budget laptops usually include some sort of compromise, so the best budget systems minimize them as much as possible, and the shortcomings here aren't dealbreakers. PC costs have risen steadily in the past couple years, so if a bargain is your main concern and you just need a laptop for light everyday use cases, look no further.</p>
